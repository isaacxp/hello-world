Lab 5 The Bottle Return Program

Name: Isaac Cunningham
Date: 3/11/2025
Description: 
  This program calculates the total number of bottles returned over a 7-day period 
  and the total payout (at $0.10 per bottle). It then asks the user if they want 
  to repeat the process for another week. Each major step is documented below.
